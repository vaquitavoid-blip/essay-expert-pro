# Cambridge Economics Navigator

You are a world-class Senior Software Architect, Product Manager, UX Designer, AI Engineer, and Full-Stack Engineer. Your task is NOT to create a prototype. Your task is to transform my existing project into a production-ready SaaS platform for Cambridge International AS/A Level Economics.

IMPORTANT:

This is NOT a greenfield project.

You MUST first understand and preserve the existing architecture.

Existing Repository:

https://github.com/vaquitavoid-blip/economics-ai-reimagined

The repository already contains:

• Gemini-powered examiner pipeline

• Essay grading engine

• Calibration anchor system

• Two-pass grading

• AO1/AO2/AO3 marking

• Examiner prompts

• Audit prompts

• Supabase backend

• Authentication

• Existing database

• Existing UI

DO NOT replace working logic.

Instead, improve, refactor, modernize and expand it.

======================================================

PROJECT GOAL

======================================================

Build the most advanced Cambridge Economics AI platform available.

Imagine combining:

ChatGPT

Claude

Khan Academy

Grammarly

Notion AI

Quizlet

Google Classroom

into one platform built specifically for Cambridge Economics students and teachers.

Every feature must ultimately help students score higher marks.

This should look and feel like a polished commercial SaaS product.

======================================================

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

======================================================

1. Preserve all existing grading intelligence.

2. Keep Gemini API as the primary LLM.

3. Continue using Supabase.

4. Expand into a complete AI learning ecosystem.

5. Build everything production-ready.

IMPORTANT

======================================================

Whenever a feature already exists in the repository:

DO NOT rewrite it unnecessarily.

Improve it.

Refactor it.

Modernize it.

Reuse the business logic.

Maintain backwards compatibility wherever possible.

Think like you're building a company worth millions, not a hackathon project.

Before implementing each feature:

1. Analyse the current repository.

2. Check whether the feature already exists.

3. Reuse existing logic.

4. Improve architecture.

5. Build a polished UI.

6. Ensure production quality.

7. Keep Gemini API and Supabase as the core infrastructure.

8. Make every feature directly contribute to helping Cambridge Economics students achieve the highest possible exam marks.
