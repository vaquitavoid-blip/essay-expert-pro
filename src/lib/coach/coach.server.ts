/**
 * AO skills coach — teaches essay writing one point at a time.
 *
 * The essay marker judges a whole answer. This coach does the opposite: the
 * student writes ONE point (an AO1 knowledge point, an AO2 analysis chain, or
 * an AO3 evaluation point) and gets told exactly what to change, sentence by
 * sentence, plus a model rewrite built from their own material.
